        Class used to describe a group representation.
        
        A (real) representation :math:`\rho` of a group :math:`G` on a vector space :math:`V=\mathbb{R}^n` is a map
        (a *homomorphism*) from the group elements to invertible matrices of shape :math:`n \times n`, i.e.:
        
        .. math::
            \rho : G \to \GL{V}
            
        such that the group composition is modeled by a matrix multiplication:
        
        .. math::
            \rho(g_1 g_2) = \rho(g_1) \rho(g_2) \qquad  \forall \ g_1, g_2 \in G \ .
        
        Any representation (of a compact group) can be decomposed into the *direct sum* of smaller, irreducible
        representations (*irreps*) of the group up to a change of basis:
        
        .. math::
            \forall \ g \in G, \ \rho(g) = Q \left( \bigoplus\nolimits_{i \in I} \psi_i(g) \right) Q^{-1} \ .
        
        Here :math:`I` is an index set over the irreps of the group :math:`G` which are contained in the
        representation :math:`\rho`.
        
        This property enables one to study a representation by its irreps and it is used here to work with arbitrary
        representations.
        
        :attr:`e2cnn.group.Representation.change_of_basis` contains the change of basis matrix :math:`Q` while
        :attr:`e2cnn.group.Representation.irreps` is an ordered list containing the names of the irreps :math:`\psi_i`
        indexed by the index set :math:`I`.
        
        A ``Representation`` instance can be used to describe a feature field in a feature map.
        It is the building block to build the representation of a feature map, by "stacking" multiple representations
        (taking their *direct sum*).
        
        .. note ::
            In most of the cases, it should not be necessary to manually instantiate this class.
            Indeed, the user can build the most common representations or some custom representations via the following
            methods and functions:
            
            - :meth:`e2cnn.group.Group.irrep`,
            
            - :meth:`e2cnn.group.Group.regular_representation`,
            
            - :meth:`e2cnn.group.Group.quotient_representation`,
            
            - :meth:`e2cnn.group.Group.induced_representation`,
            
            - :meth:`e2cnn.group.Group.restrict_representation`,
            
            - :func:`e2cnn.group.directsum`,
            
            - :func:`e2cnn.group.change_basis`
            
            
        
        If ``representation`` is ``None`` (default), it is automatically inferred by evaluating each irrep, stacking
        their results (through direct sum) and then applying the changes of basis. Warning: the representation of an
        element is built at run-time every time this object is called (through ``__call__``) and this approach might
        become computationally expensive with large representations.
        
        Analogously, if the ``character`` of the representation is ``None`` (default), it is automatically inferred
        evaluating ``representation`` and computing its trace.

def disentangle(repr: Representation) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, List[Representation]]:
    r"""
    
    If possible, disentangle the input representation by decomposing it into the direct sum of smaller representations
    and a change of basis acting as a permutation matrix.
    
    This method is useful to decompose a feature vector transforming with a complex representation into multiple feature
    vectors which transform independently with simpler representations.
    
    Note that this method only decomposes a representation by applying a permutation of axes.
    A more general decomposition using any invertible matrix is possible but is just a decomposition into
    irreducible representations (see :class:`~e2cnn.group.Representation`).
    However, since the choice of change of basis is relevant for the kind of operations which can be performed
    (e.g. non-linearities), it is often not desirable to discard any change of basis and completely disentangle a
    representation.
    
    Considering only change of basis matrices which are permutation matrices is sometimes more useful.
    For instance, the restriction of the regular representation of a group to a subgroup results in a representation containing
    multiple regular representations of the subgroup (one for each `coset`).
    However, depending on how the original representation is built, the restricted representation might not be
    block-diagonal and, so, the subgroup's regular representations might not be clearly separated.
    
    For example, this happens when restricting the regular representation of :math:`\D3`

    Indeed, in :math:`\Res{\C2}{\D3} \rho_\text{reg}^{\D3}(g)` the three pairs of entries (1, 4), (2, 6) and (3, 5)
    never mix with each other but only permute internally.
    Moreover, each pair transforms according to the regular representation of :math:`\C2`.
    Through a permutation of the entries, it is possible to make all the entries belonging to the same pair contiguous.
    This reshuffled representation is then equal to
    :math:`\rho_\text{reg}^{\C2} \oplus \rho_\text{reg}^{\C2} \oplus \rho_\text{reg}^{\C2}`.
    Though theoretically equivalent, an implementation of this representation where the entries are contiguous is
    convenient when computing functions over single fields like batch normalization.
    
    Notice that applying the change of basis returned to the input representation (e.g. through
    :func:`e2cnn.group.change_basis`) will result in a representation containing the direct sum of the representations
    in the list returned.

    r"""
    Decompose the input ``representation`` in a direct sum of irreps of the input ``group``.
    First, the method computes the multiplicities of each irrep in the representation using the inner product of their
    characters. Then, it computes the change-of-basis matrix which transforms the block-diagonal matrix coming from
    the direct sum of the irreps in the input representation.

    It returns the decomposition in irreps as a change-of-basis matrix and a list of "(irrep-name, multiplicity)" pairs,
    where "irrep-name" is the name of one of the irreps in ``group`` (a key in the :attr:`e2cnn.group.Group.irreps`
    dictionary) and "multiplicity" is the number of times this irrep appears in the decomposition.
    The order of this list follows the alphabetic order of the names and it represents the order in which the irreps
    have to be summed to build the block-diagonal representation.

    Args:
        representation: a dictionary associating to each group element a matrix representation
        group: the group whose irreps have to be used

    Returns:
        a tuple containing:

                - the change-of-basis matrix,

                - an ordered list of pairs (irrep-name, multiplicity)
