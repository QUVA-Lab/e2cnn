e2cnn documentation
=================================


Deprecation Warning: check our new `escnn <https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/escnn>`_ library which extends *e2cnn* to a wider class of equivariance groups.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While we will still provide some support for this older version,
this library is **deprecated** and we plan to slowly abandon it in favour of the newer version `escnn <https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/escnn>`_.
Note that `escnn <https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/escnn>`_ already includes all features of *e2cnn* and many more.
You can find a short summary of the main differences in the new version `here <https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/escnn/blob/master/changelog.txt>`_ .





*e2cnn* is a Pytorch based library for equivariant deep learning.

*Equivariant neural networks* guarantee a prespecified transformation behavior of their features under transformations of their input.
This package provides functionality for the equivariant processing of planar images.
It implements the *most general convolutional maps* and the *most general differential operators*
which are equivariant under the isometries of the plane, that is, under translations, rotations and reflections.


Package Reference
-----------------

The library is structured into five subpackages with different high-level features:

* :doc:`e2cnn.group <api/e2cnn.group>`         implements basic concepts of group and representation theory
    
* :doc:`e2cnn.kernels <api/e2cnn.kernels>`     solves for spaces of equivariant convolution kernels

* :doc:`e2cnn.diffops <api/e2cnn.diffops>`     solves for spaces of equivariant differential operators
    
* :doc:`e2cnn.gspaces <api/e2cnn.gspaces>`     defines the image plane and its symmetries
        
* :doc:`e2cnn.nn <api/e2cnn.nn>`               contains equivariant modules to build deep neural networks

Typically, only the high level functionalities provided in :doc:`e2cnn.gspaces <api/e2cnn.gspaces>` and 
:doc:`e2cnn.nn <api/e2cnn.nn>` are needed to build an equivariant model.


To get started, we provide an `introductory tutorial <https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/e2cnn/blob/master/examples/introduction.ipynb>`_
which introduces the basic functionality of the library.
A second `tutorial <https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/e2cnn/blob/master/examples/model.ipynb>`_ goes through building and training 
an equivariant model on the rotated MNIST dataset.
